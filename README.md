## Overview

This project involved the development of a responsive landing page for a fictional fitness company. HTML and CSS were used to create the structure and styling of the page, while JavaScript was used to add interactive elements.

The landing page was designed to be mobile-friendly, with a modern and attractive look. The header included a logo and a hamburger menu for mobile devices.

The page was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Responsive design techniques were employed to ensure the page looked great on all devices. The page was tested on multiple br

## My process

1. First, I've created a basic HTML structure with a header containing a hero image and navbar, which would collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile devices. I started building the page for mobile devices, making sure that all elements are responsive and look great on smaller screens.

2. Then, I adde a section containing a picture and text box.

3. After that, I created next section. In there I've made a div elements which containted a image, and overlay with a text which was positioned absolute. On desktop devices I added a css grid to these div elements.

4. Finally, I've adjusted the design for desktop size devices, ensuring that all elements look great and are easy to navigate.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- SASS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've got better at building a responsive design. learned how to fix some issues I had with images as a background. Then I did find a difficult at first to play with hover and pseudo-elements, but It wasn't that difficult at all.
All in all, this was a great opportunity to practice and improve my coding skills.
